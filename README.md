# Unity-Character-Controller

Features:

- Various states of movement (walking, sprinting, crouching, prone, some mixtures of multiple states) via state machine.
- Inheritance of movement, with or without rotation, from any target the player is standing on.
- Basic interaction system (interaction with switches).
- A compass with objective markers which can be sorted in a variety of ways (or not sorted, for performance reasons).
